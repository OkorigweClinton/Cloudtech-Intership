# Airline Flight Dataset Analysis – Internship Task 1

## 1. Introduction
This project was carried out as part of the Cloud Tech Internship program.  
The primary objective was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an airline flight dataset to uncover trends, generate insights, and prepare visualizations for business decision-making.  
The dataset contained **300,153 rows and 11 columns** (12 if the index column is included).

## 2. Methodology (Steps Taken)
- Imported required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
- Loaded the dataset and inspected its dimensions, column names, and data types.
- Performed data cleaning: handled missing values, duplicates, and ensured correct data types.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA): explored distributions of booking windows, ticket prices, and routes.
- Aggregated data by airline, booking window, and route for comparative insights.
- Applied descriptive statistics (mean, sum, percentages) to identify performance indicators.
- Created visualizations (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc.) to support findings.
- Derived KPIs to assess airline performance and customer booking behaviors.

## 3. Insights Generated
- Early booking (0–3 days) is associated with higher average prices compared to later booking windows.
- Airline performance varies significantly across routes, with some routes contributing disproportionately to revenue.
- Customer booking behavior shows clear peaks around short booking windows (last-minute bookings).
- Correlation observed between delay frequency and certain routes, suggesting scheduling inefficiencies.
- Revenue optimization can be achieved by adjusting dynamic pricing strategies across booking windows.

## 4. Conclusion
The analysis revealed distinct booking patterns, price differences, and performance variations across airlines and routes.  
The findings suggest opportunities for **revenue optimization** through dynamic pricing, better scheduling, and targeted promotions.  
Future work may include predictive modeling to forecast demand.
